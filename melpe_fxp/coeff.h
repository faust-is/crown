The fixed-point version of the voice codec Mixed Excitation Linear
Prediction (MELP) is based on specifications on the C-language software
simulation contained in GSM 06.06 which is protected by copyright and

tel. +33 (0)4 92 94 42 58. ETSI has granted a license to United States
Department of Defense to use the C-language software simulation contained
in GSM 06.06 for the purposes of the development of a fixed-point
version of the voice codec Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction (MELP).
